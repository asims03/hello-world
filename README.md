About Me!

My name is Ariel Sims, I have a masters degree in clinical neuroscience and I am looking to pursue my PhD in a year or two. I do not have much experience with data science, data management, and any coding, so I am trying to learn all of the basics so I can position myself for a clinical resarch position and being accepted into a Ph.D program.
